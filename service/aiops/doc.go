// The CloudWatch investigations feature is a generative AI-powered assistant that
// can help you respond to incidents in your system. It uses generative AI to scan
// your system's telemetry and quickly surface suggestions that might be related to
// your issue. These suggestions include metrics, logs, deployment events, and
// root-cause hypotheses.
//
// You can use API actions to create, manage, and delete investigation groups and
// investigation group policies. To start and manage investigations, you must use
// the CloudWatch console.
