// Package arczonalshift provides the API client, operations, and parameter types
// for AWS ARC - Zonal Shift.
//
// Welcome to the API Reference Guide for zonal shift and zonal autoshift in
// Amazon Application Recovery Controller (ARC).
//
// You can start a zonal shift to move traffic for a load balancer resource away
// from an Availability Zone to help your application recover quickly from an
// impairment in an Availability Zone. For example, you can recover your
// application from a developer's bad code deployment or from an Amazon Web
// Services infrastructure failure in a single Availability Zone.
//
// You can also configure zonal autoshift for supported load balancer resources.
// Zonal autoshift is a capability in ARC where you authorize Amazon Web Services
// to shift away application resource traffic from an Availability Zone during
// events, on your behalf, to help reduce your time to recovery. Amazon Web
// Services starts an autoshift when internal telemetry indicates that there is an
// Availability Zone impairment that could potentially impact customers.
//
// For more information about using zonal shift and zonal autoshift, see the [Amazon Application Recovery Controller Developer Guide].
