// Package marketplacereporting provides the API client, operations, and parameter
// types for AWS Marketplace Reporting Service.
//
// The AWS Marketplace GetBuyerDashboard API enables you to get a procurement
// insights dashboard programmatically. The API gets the agreement and cost
// analysis dashboards with data for all of the Amazon Web Services accounts in
// your Amazon Web Services organization.
//
// To use the API, you must complete the following prerequisites:
//
//   - Enable all features for your organization. For more information, see [Enabling all features for an organization with Amazon Web Services Organizations], in
//     the Amazon Web Services Organizations User Guide.
//
//   - Call the service as the Amazon Web Services Organizations management
//     account or an account registered as a delegated administrator for the
//     procurement insights service. Users without management or delegated
//     administrator accounts can use the dashboard, but they only see data for their
//     accounts.
//
// For more information about management accounts, see [Tutorial: Creating and configuring an organization]and [Managing the management account with Amazon Web Services Organizations], both in the Amazon
//
//	Web Services Organizations User Guide.
//
// For more information about delegated administrators, see [Using delegated administrators], in the AWS
//
//	Marketplace Buyer Guide.
//
//	- Create an IAM policy that enables the aws-marketplace:GetBuyerDashboard and
//	organizations:DescribeOrganization permissions. In addition, the management
//	account requires the organizations:EnableAWSServiceAccess and
//	iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permissions to create For more information about
//	creating the policy, see [Policies and permissions in Amazon Web Services Identity and Access Management], in the IAM User Guide.
//
//	- Use the Amazon Web Services Marketplace console to create the
//	AWSServiceRoleForProcurementInsightsPolicy service-linked role. The role
//	enables AWS Marketplace procurement visibility integration. The management
//	account requires an IAM policy with the organizations:EnableAWSServiceAccess
//	and iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole permissions to create the service-linked role
//	and enable the service access. For more information, see [Granting access to Amazon Web Services Organizations], and [Service-linked role to share procurement data], in the
//	Amazon Web Services Marketplace Buyer Guide.
